This theme was originally taken from [Linux-Mint-Y-Dark-Telegram-Theme.](https://github.com/lkd70/Linux-Mint-Y-Dark-Telegram-Theme) which is based on [MasterGroosha's SolidDark Theme](https://github.com/MasterGroosha/telegram-soliddark-theme). All credit goes to them.
Also go check out the official channel for the original theme: [@SolidDarkTheme](https://telegram.me/SolidDarkTheme)

Some steps provided by MasterGroosha on editing the theme:

1. Edit colors.tdesktop-theme file.
2. Change background (if you want). Tiled backgrounds should be named tiled.png or tiled.jpg while normal backgrounds should be names as background.png or background.jpg.
3. Pack both files into zip-archive and rename it as YOUR-THEME.tdesktop-theme (watch the extension!).
4. Send it to any chat in Telegram Desktop, then download, click and apply!
5. If you want to revert to default theme, click Use default color theme button in settings.
